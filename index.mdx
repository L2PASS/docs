The global yield landscape is broken.

More than **$17 trillion** sits in traditional savings accounts worldwide earning **less than 2% APY**, while inflation erodes real value and banks capture the spread.\
At the same time, **on-chain yield markets,** from lending and tokenized T-bills to real-world asset pools generate **5–10× higher returns**, 24/7, transparently, and without intermediaries.

Yet, despite this massive opportunity, almost no one can access it.

Even within crypto:

* Only **2% of users** interact with DeFi directly.
* Over **40–50%** express a desire to but are blocked by complexity, security risks, and lack of simple, compliant entry points.

And for fintechs or neobanks, the challenge is even greater:

* They lack the infrastructure to connect user deposits to yield safely.
* Building in-house DeFi access requires costly integrations, risk controls, and compliance overhead.
* Their users remain stuck in legacy rails, fiat deposits earning near-zero while new digital economies outperform.

**This gap between intent and access, between yield and usability, is one of the largest untapped opportunities in finance.**

**L2Pass** was created to close it.

By building an **agentic stablecoin yield infrastructure**, L2Pass enables neobanks, fintechs, and financial apps to connect directly to **both DeFi and real-world yield markets** instantly, safely, and without complexity.

That means:

* Users earn globally competitive returns through their existing fintech or neobank apps.
* Institutions maintain compliance and custody standards.
* Liquidity flows where it performs best... automatically.

Beyond returns, the implications are global.\
In emerging markets, users can deposit their local currency (pesos, naira, lira), which is converted into USD-backed stablecoins creating access to stable yields, a hedge against currency depreciation, and new pathways to long-term wealth creation.

> **L2Pass represents a new chapter for global finance where yield is intelligent, autonomous, and accessible to everyone.**
