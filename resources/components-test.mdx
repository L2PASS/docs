# Welcome to Laravel Cloud

> The official infrastructure and deployment platform for Laravel applications.

Laravel Cloud is a fully managed infrastructure platform for deploying and scaling Laravel applications, with built-in solutions for web and worker compute, relational databases, key-value storage, file / object storage, and more.

## Unmatched developer experience

Laravel Cloud is the only fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) obsessively optimized for shipping and scaling Laravel applications.

* **No application or server configuration necessary.** Most Laravel applications can be deployed to Laravel Cloud without any additional changes to your application's architecture. Additionally, no server management experience is required when deploying applications to Laravel Cloud.

* **Fully managed MySQL / Postgres databases and Redis compatible key-value storage.** You can provision and manage MySQL and Postgres databases directly from the Laravel Cloud dashboard. Redis compatible key-value storage may also be provisioned in seconds.

* **Zero downtime deployments and scaling.** Laravel Cloud automatically rolls out changes to your application without downtime. In addition, scaling your application's infrastructure can be done at anytime without interrupting your users.

* **Automatic TLS and load balancing.** All applications running on Laravel Cloud automatically receive TLS certificates, which are also automatically updated. Incoming traffic to your application is also automatically distributed across your available application replicas.

* **Cloud Edge Network.** Laravel Cloud partners with Cloudflare to offer a globally distributed caching and security network at the edge. This edge network provides DDoS protection and edge asset caching to all applications running on Laravel Cloud.

* **Monitoring and logs.** Basic infrastructure metrics such as CPU and memory usage is available via the Laravel Cloud dashboard. You may also easily view and search your application's logs.

## Next steps
