## Smart Contracts

## Security and Audits

Security is the foundation of the L2Pass protocol. Our contracts are built using industry-standard libraries such as **OpenZeppelin** and feature several layers of protection:

* 
**Non-Custodial:** The protocol never takes custody of user assets; all swaps and yield positions are managed via smart contracts.


* 
**Pausability:** In the event of extreme market volatility or external threats, the `Pausable` module allows the team to protect user funds by temporarily halting deposits.


* 
**Reentrancy Guard:** All critical functions are protected against recursive call attacks.



<Note>
**Verification Tip:** Always verify that you are interacting with the correct contract addresses. The L2Pass team will never provide addresses via direct message or unofficial social media channels.
