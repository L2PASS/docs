## Smart Contracts

The L2Pass protocol infrastructure is comprised of several core smart contracts that handle cross-chain liquid yield, asset swapping, and automated routing.

### Implementation Details

* **Multi-Chain Availability:** These contracts are deployed across all L2Pass supported networks (including Arbitrum, Base, and Linea) to ensure a seamless user experience regardless of the starting chain.
* **Verification:** All listed addresses are verified and non-custodial. Users can interact with them directly via the L2Pass interface or through their preferred block explorer.

## Security and Audits

Security is the foundation of the L2Pass protocol. Our contracts are built using industry-standard libraries such as **OpenZeppelin** and feature several layers of protection:

* 
**Non-Custodial:** The protocol never takes custody of user assets; all swaps and yield positions are managed via smart contracts.


* 
**Pausability:** In the event of extreme market volatility or external threats, the `Pausable` module allows the team to protect user funds by temporarily halting deposits.


* 
**Reentrancy Guard:** All critical functions are protected against recursive call attacks.



<Note>
**Verification Tip:** Always verify that you are interacting with the correct contract addresses. The L2Pass team will never provide addresses via direct message or unofficial social media channels.
