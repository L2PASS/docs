## Current Status

The **L2Pass Yield** product is officially deployed on mainnet. We are currently in a "soft launch" phase to monitor contract performance and security in a live environment.

### Audit Roadmap
Security is our top priority. We have a multi-stage audit process planned to ensure the safety of user funds:

* **Internal Review:** <Badge icon="circle-check" color="green">Complete</Badge> Our core engineering team has conducted extensive unit testing and simulated stress tests.
* **External Audits:** <Badge icon="clock" color="orange">Planned / In Progress</Badge> We are currently scheduling reviews with leading blockchain security firms to perform a comprehensive audit of our Yield and Bridge logic.
* **Bug Bounty:** <Badge icon="clock" color="orange">Planned</Badge>  A community-driven bug bounty program will be launched following the completion of our external audits.

  We will update this page with direct links to PDF audit reports as soon as they are finalized by our security partners.
