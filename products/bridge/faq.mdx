  <Accordion title="What is the Bridge product and how does it work?">
    The Bridge enables on-chain and cross-chain stablecoin transfers between supported blockchains using native bridges and intent-based protocols. Transfers are executed in a decentralized, non-custodial manner without asset wrapping.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the difference between Bridge and Swap?">
    Bridge transfers the same asset between blockchains, while Swap exchanges assets and may include AMM interaction and cross-chain execution in a single transaction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What assets can I transfer?">
    Supported stablecoins and networks are listed on the
    <a href="https://swap.l2pass.com" target="_blank">frontend page</a>
    and may vary by chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is price impact?">
    Price impact is the change in execution price caused by trade size relative to available liquidity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is slippage?">
    Slippage is the difference between the quoted price and the final execution price due to market movement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I configure slippage tolerance?">
    Yes. Automatic slippage is enabled by default, with manual configuration available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the expected output?">
    The expected output is the estimated amount you are likely to receive under current market conditions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the minimum received amount?">
    The minimum received amount represents the worst-case execution threshold based on your slippage tolerance. If this threshold is exceeded, the transaction reverts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What fees apply?">
    Fees may include AMM fees, cross-chain messaging fees, native bridge fees, network gas fees, and a minimal swap platform fee.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there hidden fees?">
    No. All fees are calculated and displayed before confirmation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is L2Pass Swap non-custodial?">
    Yes. Assets remain under user control throughout the entire execution process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need gas on both chains for a cross-chain swap?">
    Gas is required on the source chain. Destination chain gas may be required for subsequent interactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is cross-chain security handled?">
    Transfers rely on native bridges and intent-based protocols that require sufficient block finality before settlement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does L2Pass use wrapped or synthetic assets?">
    No. Only native assets, AMMs, and official bridges are used.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can my funds get stuck?">
    The protocol is designed to prevent trapped assets. Funds either settle successfully or are returned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a swap fails?">
    The transaction reverts. No assets are exchanged, and network gas fees are not refundable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can a cross-chain swap be partially filled?">
    No. All executions follow an all-or-nothing model.
