[L2Pass Swap](https://swap.l2pass.com/) was engineered to solve the fragmentation and inefficiency of cross-chain stablecoin liquidity. The protocol provides a streamlined, non-custodial interface for executing stablecoin swaps across multiple networks in a single transaction.

By abstracting routing complexity, the system continuously evaluates liquidity sources, fee structures, and execution paths to select the most cost-effective route at the moment of settlement. This removes the need for manual comparison of bridges or pools, ensuring users receive the optimal available outcome through a fully decentralized process.

## Architecture Summary

The L2Pass Swap architecture utilizes a modular routing and execution framework designed to maximize capital efficiency and reliability.

- **Routing:** On-chain execution integrates the OKX Router Engine and Near Intents. This multi-path evaluation system identifies the most efficient route based on liquidity depth, fee tiers, and expected execution quality.
- **Liquidity Sources:** Liquidity is sourced directly from native AMMs on each supported blockchain. By interacting with on-chain pools, L2Pass ensures market-driven execution and avoids the risks associated with synthetic pricing.
- **Bridging:** Cross-chain transfers utilize the native USDT0 bridge and Near Intents protocol. This facilitates secure, capital-efficient transfers without the use of wrapped assets or third-party custody.

## Execution & Settlement

Settlement latency is determined by the specific source and destination network parameters:

- **On-chain Swaps:** Execution is typically near-instant, settling within 1 to 2 blocks.
- **Cross-chain Swaps:** Standard transactions settle within 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
- **Real-time Estimates:** Expected execution time is displayed on the interface prior to transaction confirmation.

In rare scenarios involving specific network conditions, processing can take up to 12 hours. This is a security measure based on blockchain block finality to ensure a transaction cannot be reverted.

## Slippage and Price Impact

**Price Impact** refers to the price shift caused by the trade size relative to the available pool liquidity. L2Pass utilizes an advanced routing system to minimize this impact by selecting paths with the highest liquidity depth and lowest fees.

**Slippage** represents the price variance between transaction submission and on-chain execution. To manage this risk, the protocol offers flexible controls:

- **Automatic Slippage:** This default setting dynamically adjusts tolerance based on real-time market volatility to optimize the probability of successful execution.
- **Manual Control:** For experienced users requiring granular control, the interface provides a manual input option to define a custom slippage percentage.
- **Minimum Received:** The interface displays a **Minimum Received** value. This represents the worst-case settlement threshold. If network conditions cause the price to deviate beyond this limit, the smart contract will automatically **revert** the transaction to protect your capital.

## Fee Structure

Transparency is a core protocol principle: every fee component is calculated and displayed within the quote prior to confirmation.

### Gas Fees

Every blockchain interaction requires a network fee (Gas) paid in the native token (e.g., ETH, MATIC, or BNB). These fees are determined by network congestion and are not controlled by the protocol.

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** If you have gas on one network but are missing it on another, you can use our [**Gas Refuel**](https://l2pass.com/refuel) service to bridge native tokens instantly and avoid getting stuck.

### Infrastructure & Provider Fees

These fees are charged by the underlying layers facilitating the transfer. The routing engine ensures the best available route is selected by evaluating:

- **Liquidity Providers (AMM):** Fees paid to the pools where the swap occurs.
- **Cross-Chain Messaging:** Costs for secure data transfer protocols such as LayerZero or Near Intents.
- **Native Bridges:** Fees associated with official network-specific bridges.

### Platform Fee

This fee supports the ongoing development and maintenance of the L2Pass infrastructure:

- **Bridging:** Currently, a **0% platform fee** is applied to asset bridging.
- **Swapping:** A minimal fee is charged, often as low as **1 pip (0.0001%)**.

## Execution Guarantees

The protocol follows an "all-or-nothing" execution model. If a critical failure occurs, the contract fails-safe to prevent partial fills or trapped assets.

- **Slippage Reversion:** If market conditions exceed your tolerance, the transaction reverts. Assets are not exchanged, though network gas fees are consumed by the network.
- **Quote Expiry:** For intent-based transactions, a quote may expire due to extreme latency. In these cases, funds either remain in your custody or are returned directly to your wallet.
