## Overview

**L2Pass Liquid Yield** is a non-custodial yield product that enables users to earn yield on stablecoin liquidity without lockups or withdrawal cooldowns.

The protocol is designed to:

- Maximize capital efficiency
- Preserve full liquidity at all times
- Abstract underlying DeFi interactions through a simplified user experience

In its current version, L2Pass Liquid Yield operates on the **TRON network**, targeting the largest USDT liquidity environment.

Users deposit **USDT (TRC20)** into the L2Pass **Smart Liquid Vault**, which programmatically routes liquidity through established on-chain mechanisms to generate yield. While the yield strategy is abstracted from the user, all accounting and interactions remain transparent and verifiable on-chain.

Additional networks and yield sources may be supported in future versions.
