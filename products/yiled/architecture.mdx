## System Overview

Overnight Yield is a non-custodial interoperability component within the L2Pass protocol designed to provide stablecoin yield without lockup periods or withdrawal cooldowns. The protocol automates the deployment of USDT into established yield-generating venues on the TRON network, utilizing the Peg Stability Module (PSM) and JustLend for liquidity routing.

The system abstracts the complexity of manual cross-token swaps and lending interactions, enabling users to maintain a liquid position while accruing rewards based on a streaming weight mechanism.

At a high level, L2Pass Liquid Yield consists of:

- A **Smart Liquid Vault**
- An **NFT-based position accounting system**
- A **reward pipeline with weekly epochs**
- Integration with **USDD PSM** and **JustLend**

The protocol automates yield generation while keeping funds non-custodial and transparent.

The system is composed of five logical layers:

### 1. Finality Layer

The underlying blockchains providing consensus, security, and settlement for all transactions.

- **TRON** (primary execution and yield settlement layer)
- **Ethereum** (future expansion, roadmap)

### 2. Transfer Layer

- Native **USDT (TRC20)**
- PSM (USDT ⇄ USDD)
- Cross-chain intents and bridges (roadmap)

### 3. User Layer

- Frontend deposit / withdraw
- Position analytics & transparency
- Fiat on/off ramps + KYC (roadmap)

### 4. Smart Vault Layer

- Smart Liquid Vault
- Vault accounting
- Reward pipeline
- Risk parameters
- Liquidity rebalancing (roadmap)

### 5. Yield Layer

- **JustLend** (as a yield source)
- Weekly L2Pass/JustLend incentives
- Cross-chain Yield Optimizer (roadmap)
