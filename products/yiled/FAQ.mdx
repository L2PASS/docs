## L2Pass Liquid Yield — FAQ

This section answers common questions about how L2Pass Liquid Yield works, how yield is generated, and what risks users should consider.

---

## 1. General & Product Overview

### What is L2Pass Liquid Yield?

L2Pass Liquid Yield is a non-custodial yield product that enables users to earn yield on stablecoin liquidity without lockups or withdrawal cooldowns. Users deposit USDT on TRON, and the protocol automatically routes liquidity through on-chain yield strategies while preserving full withdrawal flexibility.

---

### Which assets can I deposit? 

Currently, L2Pass Liquid Yield supports deposits in **USDT (TRC20)** on the TRON network. Support for additional assets and networks may be introduced in future versions.


---

### Is L2Pass Liquid Yield custodial?

No. L2Pass Liquid Yield is non-custodial. User funds are managed by smart contracts, and ownership is enforced through on-chain accounting and Position NFTs.

---

### What do I receive after depositing?

After depositing, you receive a **L2Pass Position NFT**.\
This NFT represents your position in the protocol and tracks:

- Deposited principal
- Accrued rewards
- Withdrawal eligibility

---

### What are L2Pass Position NFTs?

Position NFTs are non-transferable NFTs minted once per user. They are used exclusively for internal accounting and position tracking. The NFT’s properties update as your position state changes.

Position NFTs are not designed to be traded or transferred.

---

### Where can I track my position?

You can track your active positions, accrued rewards, claimable rewards, and withdrawal history directly in the L2Pass interface.

---

### Do I need TRX to use the protocol?

Yes. Transactions on the TRON network require sufficient **TRX or Energy**.\
Users may optionally rent Energy through third-party services to reduce transaction costs.

---

## 2. Yield, Rewards & Economics

### What is the source of yield?

Yield is generated from:

- Lending **USDD** on **JustLend**
- Weekly incentive distributions from **L2Pass** and/or **JustLend**

Yield is variable and depends on market conditions and incentive programs.

---

### Is the yield guaranteed?

No. Yield is not guaranteed and may fluctuate over time based on utilization rates, demand, and incentive availability.

---

### How often can I claim rewards?

Rewards accrue continuously but become **claimable on a weekly basis** after each reward epoch is finalized.

---

### In which token are rewards paid?

Rewards are paid in **USDT**.

---

### Does claiming rewards affect my principal?

No. Claiming rewards does not affect your deposited principal.

---

### Can I withdraw and still claim rewards?

Yes. Any rewards accrued for completed reward epochs remain claimable even after you withdraw part or all of your principal.

---

### Are there any fees?

- No deposit fees
- No withdrawal fees (excluding PSM conversion spread)
- No protocol performance fees in the current version

A performance fee applied only to yield may be introduced in future versions via protocol parameters.

---

## 3. Deposits, Withdrawals & Positions

### Can I withdraw my funds at any time?

Yes. You can withdraw your funds **partially or fully at any time**.

---

### Are there lockups or withdrawal cooldowns?

No. There are no lockups or withdrawal cooldowns.

---

### Are Position NFTs transferable?

No. Position NFTs are non-transferable and remain bound to the original depositor’s wallet.

This design simplifies accounting, preserves clear ownership, and reduces protocol-level risk.

---

### Is there any liquidation risk?

No. The protocol does not support borrowing or leverage.\
There are no liquidation mechanics.

---

## 4. Risks, Assets & Governance

### What are the main risks?

Key risks include:

- Smart contract risk
- External protocol risk (JustLend, USDD PSM)
- Stablecoin risk (USDT, USDD)
- Yield variability

Users are encouraged to review the full **Risks** section before depositing.

---

### What is USDD?

USDD is a decentralized stablecoin issued on the TRON network, designed to maintain a value close to the US dollar. Within L2Pass Liquid Yield, USDD is used as the underlying yield-bearing asset routed through external lending markets.

For more details, refer to the official USDD documentation:\
https://docs.usdd.io/

---

### Is my deposit insured?

No. Deposits are not insured, and there is no guarantee of recovery in the event of protocol or external failures.

---

### Who controls the protocol parameters?

Before TGE, protocol parameters may be adjusted by the L2Pass team.\
After TGE, changes are expected to be governed through the protocol’s governance framework.
