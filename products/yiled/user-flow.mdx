# L2Pass Liquid Yield: User Flow

This section describes the end-to-end lifecycle of a user interacting with L2Pass Liquid Yield, from deposit to reward claims and withdrawals.

## High-level flow

<Steps>

 <Step title="Visit earn.l2pass.com">
 Open **https://earn.l2pass.com** to access the Liquid Yield product.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    The user connects a TRON-compatible wallet to the L2Pass interface.
    The wallet is authenticated, the TRON network is verified, and the user’s USDT and TRX balances are displayed.
    <Info>
To use the product, you need a TRON-compatible wallet such as **TronLink**: https://www.tronlink.org/. You can top up your wallet USDT TRC20 balance from any centralized exchange (CEX).
</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deposit USDT">
    The user selects an amount of **USDT (TRC20)** and confirms the deposit transaction in their wallet.
    The interface displays information about next weekly reward distribution and required network resources.
    <Info>
Deposits require sufficient **TRX or Energy** to cover TRON network fees.
Renting Energy is often a more efficient and cost-effective option. Energy can be rented through third-party services such as https://netts.io/?lang=en.
</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Smart Liquid Vault">
    The deposited USDT is received by the L2Pass **Smart Liquid Vault**, which manages user accounting and executes the yield strategy on-chain.
  <text title="PSM: USDT → USDD">
    The Smart Liquid Vault converts USDT to **USDD** via the Peg Stability Module (PSM) at a 1:1 rate.</text>
  <text title="JustLend: Supply USDD → jUSDD">
    The converted USDD is supplied to **JustLend**, where it is lent to the market and represented by **jUSDD**.
    This step is the primary source of base yield.
  </text>

  <Step title="Mint Position NFT">
    A non-transferable **Position NFT** is minted to the user’s wallet.
    The NFT represents the user’s position and tracks deposited principal, accrued rewards, and ownership.
    <Info>
The first deposit may require more **Energy** or **TRX** because the Position NFT is minted at this step.
The NFT is minted only once per user. Next deposits do not require NFT minting and typically cost **35–40% less** in network resources.
</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yield Accrual">
    Yield begins accruing automatically from JustLend lending rates and protocol incentive distributions.
  <Info>
Rewards accrue continuously and are finalized on a **weekly basis**.
Users can claim rewards for all completed reward epochs in a single transaction, covering every week they participated.
</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim Rewards / Withdraw Principal">
    The user may claim eligible rewards or withdraw their principal partially or in full at any time.
    Previously accrued rewards remain claimable even after principal withdrawal.
    <Info>
      Any rewards earned during completed epochs remain claimable, even after the user has fully exited the position. The interface continues to display eligible reward epochs until all rewards are claimed.
      </Info>
