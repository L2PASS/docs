# L2Pass Liquid Yield: User Flow

This section describes the end-to-end lifecycle of a user interacting with L2Pass Liquid Yield, from deposit to reward claims and withdrawals.

## High-level flow

<Steps>

  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    The user connects a TRON-compatible wallet to the L2Pass interface.
    The wallet is authenticated, the TRON network is verified, and the user’s USDT and TRX balances are displayed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deposit USDT">
    The user selects an amount of **USDT (TRC20)** and confirms the deposit transaction in their wallet.
    The interface displays information about weekly reward distribution and required network resources.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Smart Liquid Vault">
    The deposited USDT is received by the L2Pass **Smart Liquid Vault**, which manages user accounting and executes the yield strategy on-chain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="PSM: USDT → USDD">
    The Smart Liquid Vault converts USDT to **USDD** via the Peg Stability Module (PSM) at a 1:1 rate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="JustLend: Supply USDD → jUSDD">
    The converted USDD is supplied to **JustLend**, where it is lent to the market and represented by **jUSDD**.
    This step is the primary source of base yield.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mint Position NFT">
    A non-transferable **Position NFT** is minted to the user’s wallet.
    The NFT represents the user’s position and tracks deposited principal, accrued rewards, and ownership.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yield Accrual">
    Yield begins accruing automatically from JustLend lending rates and protocol incentive distributions.
    Rewards accumulate continuously and are finalized on a weekly basis.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim Rewards / Withdraw Principal">
    The user may claim eligible rewards or withdraw their principal partially or in full at any time.
    Previously accrued rewards remain claimable even after principal withdrawal.
  </Step>

</Steps>



Any rewards earned during completed epochs remain claimable, even after the user has fully exited the position. The interface continues to display eligible reward epochs until all rewards are claimed.
