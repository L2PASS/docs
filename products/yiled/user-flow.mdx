## L2Pass Liquid Yield

<Steps>

  <Step title="Visit earn.l2pass.com">
    Open **https://earn.l2pass.com** to access the Liquid Yield product.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    The user connects a TRON-compatible wallet to the L2Pass interface.
    The wallet is authenticated, the TRON network is verified, and the user’s USDT and TRX balances are displayed.

      style={{ height: "260px", width: "420px" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Info>
      To use the product, you need a TRON-compatible wallet such as **TronLink**:
      [tronlink.org](https://www.tronlink.org/).  
      You can top up your USDT (TRC20) balance from any centralized exchange (CEX).
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deposit USDT">
    The user selects an amount of **USDT (TRC20)** and confirms the deposit transaction in their wallet.
    The interface displays information about the next weekly reward distribution and required network resources.

      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Tip>
      Deposits require sufficient **TRX or Energy** to cover TRON network fees.  
      Renting Energy is often a more efficient and ~80% cost-effective option.
      Energy can be rented via services such as
      [netts.io](https://netts.io/?lang=en).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Smart Liquid Vault">
    The deposited USDT is received by the L2Pass **Smart Liquid Vault**, which manages user accounting and executes the yield strategy on-chain.

    **PSM: USDT → USDD**
      The Smart Liquid Vault converts USDT to **USDD** via the Peg Stability Module (PSM) at a 1:1 rate.


 **JustLend: Supply USDD → jUSDD**
      The converted USDD is supplied to **JustLend**, where it is lent to the market and represented by **jUSDD**.  
      This step is the primary source of base yield.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mint Position NFT">
    A non-transferable **Position NFT** is minted to the user’s wallet.
    The NFT represents the user’s position and tracks deposited principal, accrued rewards, and ownership.

      alt="L2Pass Position NFT"
      style={{ height: "260px", width: "420px" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Tip>
      The first deposit may require more **Energy or TRX** because the Position NFT is minted at this step.  
      The NFT is minted only once per user. Subsequent deposits typically cost
      **35–40% less** in network resources.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yield Accrual / Claim Rewards">
    Yield begins accruing automatically from JustLend lending rates and protocol incentive distributions.

    <Info>
      Rewards accrue continuously and are finalized on a **weekly basis**.  
      Users can claim rewards for all completed reward epochs in a single transaction.

      style={{ height: "260px", width: "420px" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />
    
  </Step>


  <Step title="Withdraw Principal">
    The user may withdraw their principal partially or in full at any time.

      alt="User flow – withdraw principal"
      style={{ height: "260px", width: "420px" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Info>
          Previously accrued rewards remain claimable even after principal withdrawal.
