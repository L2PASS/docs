## General & Product Overview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is L2Pass Liquid Yield?">
    L2Pass Liquid Yield is a non-custodial yield product that enables users to earn yield on stablecoin liquidity without lockups or withdrawal cooldowns.

    Users deposit USDT on TRON, and the protocol programmatically routes liquidity through on-chain yield strategies while preserving full withdrawal flexibility.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which assets can I deposit?">
    Currently, L2Pass Liquid Yield supports deposits in **USDT (TRC20)** on the TRON network.

    Support for additional assets and networks may be introduced in future versions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is L2Pass Liquid Yield custodial?">
    No. L2Pass Liquid Yield is non-custodial. User funds are managed by smart contracts, and ownership is enforced through on-chain accounting and Position NFTs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I receive after depositing?">
    After depositing, you receive a **L2Pass Position NFT** that represents your yield position.

    The NFT tracks your deposited principal, accrued rewards, and withdrawal eligibility.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are L2Pass Position NFTs?">
    Position NFTs are non-transferable NFTs minted once per user and used exclusively for internal accounting.

    The NFT’s properties update automatically as the position state changes and are not intended to be traded or transferred.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I track my position?">
    You can view your active positions, accrued rewards, claimable rewards, and withdrawal history directly in the L2Pass interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need TRX to use the protocol?">
    Yes. Transactions on the TRON network require sufficient **TRX or Energy**.

    Users may optionally rent Energy via third-party services to reduce transaction costs.
  </Accordion>

## Yield, Rewards & Economics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the source of yield?">
    Yield is generated from lending **USDD** on **JustLend**, combined with weekly incentive distributions from L2Pass and/or JustLend.

    Yield is variable and depends on market conditions and incentive programs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the yield guaranteed?">
    No. Yield is not guaranteed and may fluctuate over time depending on utilization, demand, and incentive availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often can I claim rewards?">
    Rewards accrue continuously but become **claimable on a weekly basis** once each reward epoch is finalized.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="In which token are rewards paid?">
    Rewards are paid in **USDT**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does claiming rewards affect my principal?">
    No. Claiming rewards does not affect your deposited principal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I withdraw and still claim rewards?">
    Yes. Rewards accrued for completed reward epochs remain claimable even after you withdraw part or all of your principal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any fees?">
    There are no deposit fees and no withdrawal fees, excluding the PSM conversion spread.

    No protocol performance fees are applied in the current version. A performance fee applied only to yield may be introduced in future versions via protocol parameters.
  </Accordion>

## Deposits, Withdrawals & Positions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I withdraw my funds at any time?">
    Yes. You can withdraw your funds partially or fully at any time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there lockups or withdrawal cooldowns?">
    No. There are no lockups or withdrawal cooldowns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are Position NFTs transferable?">
    No. Position NFTs are non-transferable and remain bound to the original depositor’s wallet.

    This design simplifies accounting, preserves clear ownership, and reduces protocol-level risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there any liquidation risk?">
    No. The protocol does not support borrowing or leverage, and there are no liquidation mechanics.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Risks, Assets & Governance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the main risks?">
    Key risks include smart contract risk, external protocol risk (JustLend, USDD PSM), stablecoin risk (USDT, USDD), and yield variability.

    Users are encouraged to review the full Risks section before depositing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is USDD?">
    USDD is a decentralized stablecoin issued on the TRON network and designed to maintain a value close to the US dollar.

    Within L2Pass Liquid Yield, USDD is used as the underlying yield-bearing asset routed through external lending markets.

    For more details, refer to the official USDD documentation:  
    https://docs.usdd.io/
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my deposit insured?">
    No. Deposits are not insured, and there is no guarantee of recovery in the event of protocol or external failures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who controls the protocol parameters?">
    Before TGE, protocol parameters may be adjusted by the L2Pass team.

    After TGE, changes are expected to be governed through the protocol’s governance framework.
  </Accordion>
