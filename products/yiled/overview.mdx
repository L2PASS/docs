**L2Pass Yield** is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that allows you to earn competitive returns on your stablecoins without giving up control or liquidity. Designed for both retail users and crypto-native businesses, the protocol automates complex DeFi strategies into a simple "deposit and earn" experience.

Currently operating on the **TRON network**, Overnight Yield leverages the ecosystem's massive USDT liquidity to provide a stable and efficient yield environment.

## Key Properties

- **Instant Liquidity:** There are no lockup periods or withdrawal cooldowns. Your assets remain liquid and accessible 24/7. **Full Transparency:** Every interaction happens on-chain. You can verify the protocol's health and your own rewards at any time.
- **Non-Custodial:** You always retain ownership of your funds through audited smart contracts.
- **NFT-Based Positions:** Your staking position is uniquely represented by a **Soulbound NFT**. This digital asset features dynamic on-chain art that updates to show your current balance and pending rewards directly in your wallet.
- **Automated Efficiency:** The protocol simplifies your experience by programmatically managing stablecoin swaps and lending supply, while ensuring fair reward calculations.

## Yield & Incentives

Your returns come from two primary sources:

- **Lending Interest:** Earned directly from supplying liquidity to the JustLend protocol.
- **Incentives:** Additional USDT-denominated rewards distributed weekly by the JustLend & L2Pass teams to boost your overall performance.

<Note>
  Future roadmap considerations include new yiled sources and cross-chain yield aggregation with dynamic multi-strategy optimization.
