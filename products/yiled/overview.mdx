## Welcome to Overnight Yield

**Overnight Yield** is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that allows you to earn competitive returns on your stablecoins without giving up control or liquidity. Designed for both retail users and crypto-native businesses, the protocol automates complex DeFi strategies into a simple "deposit and earn" experience.

Currently operating on the **TRON network**, Overnight Yield leverages the ecosystem's massive USDT liquidity to provide a stable and efficient yield environment.

## Key Properties

* **Maximum Liquidity:** No mandatory lockups or withdrawal cooldowns; access your funds when you need them.
**Full Transparency:** Every interaction happens on-chain. You can verify the protocol's health and your own rewards at any time.
* **Non-Custodial Design:** Assets are managed by verified smart contracts where users retain ultimate control of their capital.
* **NFT-Based Positions:** Your staking position is uniquely represented by a **Soulbound NFT**. This digital asset features dynamic on-chain art that updates to show your current balance and pending rewards directly in your wallet.
* **Automated Efficiency:** The protocol simplifies your experience by programmatically managing stablecoin swaps and lending supply, while ensuring fair reward calculations.

## Yield & Incentives

Your returns come from two primary sources:

* **Lending Interest:** Earned directly from supplying liquidity to the JustLend protocol.

* **Incentives:** Additional USDT-denominated rewards distributed weekly by the JustLend/L2Pass team to boost your overall performance.


<Note>
Future roadmap considerations include cross-chain yield aggregation and dynamic multi-strategy optimization across additional networks.
