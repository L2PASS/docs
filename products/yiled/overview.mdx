## Overview

**Overnight Yield** (L2Pass Liquid Yield) is a non-custodial protocol designed to provide seamless stablecoin yield without the constraints of traditional lockup periods or withdrawal cooldowns. 

The protocol automates the deployment of **USDT (TRC20)** into established yield-generating venues on the **TRON network**, specifically targeting the most liquid USDT environment in the industry. By programmatically routing liquidity through the **Peg Stability Module (PSM)** and **JustLend**, L2Pass abstracts the complexity of manual yield farming while maintaining full on-chain transparency.

## Key Properties

* **Maximum Liquidity:** No mandatory lockups or withdrawal cooldowns; access your funds when you need them.
* **Non-Custodial Design:** Assets are managed by verified smart contracts where users retain ultimate control of their capital.
* **NFT-Based Positions:** Each staking position is represented by a unique Soulbound Token (SBT), featuring on-chain SVG metadata that displays real-time balance and rewards.
* **Automated Routing:** Programmatic execution of USDT ↔ USDD swaps and lending supply to optimize efficiency.
* **Streaming Rewards:** Reward distribution is calculated per-second and settled on a weekly epoch basis.

## Architecture & Mechanics

The protocol utilizes a modular "Smart Liquid Vault" architecture to manage the lifecycle of a deposit:

1.  **Entry:** Users deposit USDT, which the vault converts to USDD via the Peg Stability Module (PSM).
2.  **Deployment:** The USDD is supplied to JustLend to mint interest-bearing **jUSDD**.
3.  **Accounting:** User positions are tracked via `amountActive` and an assigned Soulbound NFT.
4.  **Exit:** Users can withdraw back to USDT (standard path) or withdraw raw USDD (direct path) to bypass external liquidity constraints.

## Yield Strategy (TRON)

The vault currently executes a conservative strategy focused on capital preservation and consistent returns:

* **Primary Source:** Organic lending interest generated through **JustLend**.
* **Secondary Incentives:** USDT-denominated rewards distributed weekly from the **L2Pass** ecosystem and/or partner protocols.

<Note>
  Future roadmap considerations include cross-chain yield aggregation and dynamic multi-strategy optimization across additional networks.
