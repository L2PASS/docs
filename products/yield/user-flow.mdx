## L2Pass Yield

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit earn.l2pass.com">
    Open [**https://earn.l2pass.com**](https://earn.l2pass.com) to access the  Yield product.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    The user connects a TRON-compatible wallet to the L2Pass interface. The wallet is authenticated, the TRON network is verified, and the user’s USDT and TRX balances are displayed.

      style={{ height:"420px",width:"auto" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Info>
      To use the product, you need a TRON-compatible wallet such as [**TronLink**](https://www.tronlink.org/).\
      You can top up your USDT (TRC20) balance from any centralized exchange (CEX) or swap & bridge stablecoin assets from EVM-chain using our non-custodial, no-KYC [Bridge](https://swap.l2pass.com).
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deposit USDT">
    The user selects an amount of **USDT (TRC20)** and confirms the deposit transaction in their wallet. The interface displays information about the next weekly reward distribution and required network resources.

      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Tip>
      Executing deposits on TRON requires **Energy** or the burning of **TRX** for gas fees. For maximum cost-efficiency, we recommend using **Energy Rental** services like [**netts.io**](http://netts.io), which typically reduce transaction overhead by **~80%** compared to burning TRX.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart Liquid Vault">
    User-deposited USDT is held in the L2Pass **Smart Liquid Vault**, which manages accounting and executes the yield strategy on-chain.

    **PSM: USDT → USDD** USDT is converted to USDD via the Peg Stability Module (PSM) at a 1:1 ratio.\
    \
    **JustLend: Supply USDD → jUSDD** The resulting USDD is supplied to JustLend and represented as jUSDD, generating base lending yield.

    <Info>
      **Unwind Process: **Withdrawals follow the reverse sequence: jUSDD is redeemed from JustLend, converted back to USDT via the PSM, and returned to the user.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Position NFT">
    A non-transferable **Soulbound NFT** is minted to your wallet upon your first deposit. This unique asset serves as your position receipt, programmatically tracking your principal, rewards, and ownership on-chain.

      style={{ height:"420px",width:"auto" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Tip>
      Your initial deposit incurs a higher **Energy** cost due to the one-time minting of your **Soulbound NFT** position. Because this NFT is only minted once per account, all subsequent deposits are significantly more efficient, typically requiring **40% less** in network resources.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Rewards">
    Yield begins accruing automatically from JustLend lending rates and protocol incentive distributions.

      style={{ height:"420px",width:"auto" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    <Info>
      Rewards accrue continuously and are finalized on a **weekly basis**.\
      Users can claim rewards for all completed reward epochs in a single transaction.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Withdraw Principal">
    The user may withdraw their principal partially or in full at any time.

      style={{ height:"420px",width:"auto" }}

    />

    <Info>
      Previously accrued rewards remain claimable even after principal withdrawal.
