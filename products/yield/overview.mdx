**Overnight Yield** is a non-custodial stablecoin yield strategy that continuously deploys user USDT into yield sources on the TRON network by swapping it into USDD and supplying it to lending markets like JustLend. Users retain full withdrawal flexibility with no lockups while earning interest and periodic rewards based on the time-weighted size of their position tracked through a streaming weight model. It abstracts cross-token swaps and lending interactions so that capital remains productive while liquid and rewards accrue automatically over weekly periods.

## Key Properties

- **Non-Custodial Instant Liquidity**\
  Assets remain fully under user control with no lockups or withdrawal delays.
- **On-Chain Transparency**\
  All interactions, positions, and rewards are executed and verifiable on-chain.
- **NFT-Based Positions**\
  Each position is represented by a Soulbound NFT reflecting balance and accrued rewards through dynamic on-chain metadata.
- **Automated Capital Allocation**\
  Stablecoin routing, lending supply and reward calculations are managed programmatically to optimize execution and accuracy while preserve full transparancy.

## Yield & Incentives

Your returns come from two primary sources:

- **Lending Interest:** Earned directly from supplying liquidity to the JustLend protocol.
- **Incentives:** Additional USDT-denominated rewards are distributed weekly by JustLend to the Smart Liquid Vault and subsequently allocated to users on the following day..
- **Points:** L2Pass operates a points-based incentive program for this product.\
  Points are tracked internally. There is currently no public dashboard or leaderboard.\
  Upon public enrollment, all eligible historical activity will be accounted for retroactively.
